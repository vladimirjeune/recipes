Ingredients:
  - 2 cups flour (1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup all purpose unbleached)
  - 3/4 cups honey
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp baking soda
  - 1 cup mashed bananas (usually about 3)
  - 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil (flowery smelling, not peppery)
  - 2 eggs (or egg substitute, like EnerG egg replacer)
  - 1 cup white chocolate chips (regular or mini) 
  - 1/2 cups chopped walnuts, roasted

Directions:
  1.) Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Butter a muffin pan with butter or oil
  	  spray.

  2.) In a large bowl: mix the wet ingredients.  Mix honey and oil; then eggs, 
  	  then mix in mashed banana.

  3.) In a medium bowl: mix the 2 flours, baking powder, salt, baking soda, 
      white chocolate chips, and chopped roasted walnuts.

  4.) Mix dry ingredients into the wet with a large spoon until evenly
  	  incorporated.  Let rest for 15-20 minutes for the whole wheat to 
  	  properly hydrate.

  5.) Place even amount into muffin tin and place in oven for 25-27 minutes.
      Honey can burn; so if it gets dark too early cover with aluminum foil.
      Use toothpick to check doneness.
      When done, cool in pan for 15 minutes.
